# Delivery Route Optimization (Capstone Assignment)

This project implements a simplified delivery route optimization model using multiple algorithmic strategies. The assignment integrates recurrence-based cost estimation, greedy parcel selection, dynamic programming for time windows, graph algorithms for shortest paths, and TSP for optimal routing.

## What the Notebook Covers
- Input modeling (locations, distances, parcel attributes)
- Greedy algorithm for value–weight parcel selection
- Basic DP-ready structure for time-window feasibility
- Dijkstra-ready graph section (placeholder)
- Brute‑force TSP for small customer sets
- Outputs: selected parcels, route cost, optimal TSP route

## Running the Notebook
```
pip install matplotlib networkx memory-profiler
jupyter notebook delivery_route_optimization.ipynb
```

## Files
- `delivery_route_optimization.ipynb` — full code
- `README.md` — project overview
- `requirements.txt` (optional)
